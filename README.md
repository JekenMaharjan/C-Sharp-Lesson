# 📘 C-Sharp-Lesson

This repository contains my **C# learning journey**, where I practice and store simple examples while learning the fundamentals of the C# programming language.

I created this repository mainly to **learn step by step**, write clean beginner-level code, and build a strong foundation before moving on to advanced topics like **ASP.NET and .NET Core**.
