# 📘 C-Sharp-Lesson

This repository contains my **C# learning journey**, where I practice and store simple examples while learning the fundamentals of the C# programming language.

I created this repository mainly to **learn step by step**, write clean beginner-level code, and build a strong foundation before moving on to advanced topics like **ASP.NET and .NET Core**.

## 🎯 Why I Made This Repository

- To understand C# basics clearly  
- To practice programming logic regularly  
- To keep all my C# lessons in one place  
- To build confidence with console applications  

This repo follows a **simple and traditional learning approach**: learn the basics well, practice them, and then move forward.
